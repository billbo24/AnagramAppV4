# AnagramAppV4
Creating new repository for updated anagram app.  This is a nightmare.  In the future I think I will avoid reusing old projects.
There has to be a better way, but reusing an old project as a template required a lot of little manual fixes on little things
underneath the hood.  

Anyway this is the most up to date version of the app.  It's coming along.  Will likely just make all changes here and not build them
into new versions unless I'm starting from scratch.
